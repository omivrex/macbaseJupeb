            <BoldedText>How to Handle JUPEB Examination Tension </BoldedText>
            <CText>
                1. One of the major ways to handle JUPEB exam tension is to read ahead of the examination. For example, you are expected to have read a particular topic before a lecturer comes to class to teach it. This is one of the major reasons why we highly recommend the JUPEB syllabus for all our students.

            <CText>
                2. We advise students to stop anything about reading for a particular course 30min before the examination. It is good to do revision before the examination but when it comes to reading fresh topics, you can get yourself confused at the end of the day.

            <CText>
                3. As a result of fear, some students tend to forget what they have read when they get to the examination hall. Another thing you need to do is to be positive-minded. You should be confident that no matter what happens, you are going to scale through. Your confidence level goes a long way.

                4. Follow the steps from 1-3 and commit your examination to God’s hands than see what happens.

            <BoldedText>How to prepare For JUPEB Examination</BoldedText>
            <CText>
                1. After registration for the JUPEB program, you are expected to make payments for accommodation and acceptance fees. Do not relax when you resume. You are expected to attend classes and participate in all the text. This alone will form 70% of your preparation. Do not joke with it.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                2. We advise all JUPEB candidates to get the Macbase JUPEB past questions and answers for both app and textbook to enhance their chances of survival. According to research, a number of JUPEB questions are repeated yearly. From experience, JUPEB's past questions and answers alone are capable of giving you 15points if you follow the first point.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                3. Finally, be composed in the examination hall. Sometimes you might feel there’s nothing in your head. Just wait for the question paper to come, you will be surprised how the ideas will fly out. For this to happen, avoid tension.

            <BoldedText> Tips Our Students Use to Pass JUPEB Exams Without Stress. </BoldedText>
            <CText>
                1. Know the Nature of the JUPEB Examination 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                This also applies to all other examinations. This includes knowing the number of questions that will be set in each subject you will be writing and knowing the time that will be given for each exam. This will help prepare your mind for what you are likely going to meet.
            </CText>

            <CText>
                2. Let there be a resolution in your mind that you must pass 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                Failure or success in any exam you write begins from the mind. A positive mindset is like a driving force that propels you to success. Always remember that “whatever the mind can conceive, it can achieve”.  Once there is a resolution, you tend to read with directions.
            </CText>

            <CText>
                3. Discover the best time that favors your reading 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                This will go a long way in helping you read rightly and not forcefully. There is a general belief that the best time to read is at night. Actually, night reading doesn’t work for everyone, some people tend to assimilate better during the day. Therefore, the best thing is to read in your own time.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                4. Study rightly and effectively 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                The first step to achieving this is preparing a personal timetable for yourself in order to guide you. JUPEB is an Advanced level examination (A – level) , which means you must get nothing but A-level textbooks to read. Using O’level books will help you in no way.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                5. Get JUPEB past questions to enhance your study 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                Research has shown that those who study with past questions for an examination tend to perform much better than those who read textbooks alone. Testing yourself with past questions will help you determine how ready you are for an exam.
            </CText>

            <CText>
                6. Teach what you read 
            </CText>
            <CText>
                This is the most tested and proven fact. Teaching what you have read helps you understand the topic better. It also helps it store better in your brain for easy reference.
            </CText>

            <CText>
                Follow all instructions strictly during the examination
            </CText>
            <CText>
                Adhering strictly to instructions provided is part of passing the JUPEB exam. Therefore, read all instructions carefully before starting.

            <BoldedText>Why do you need a JUPEB Textbook?</BoldedText>
            <CText>
                The JUPEB exam has a unique syllabus. Each syllabus is structured into four-unit courses (e.g. BIO 001, 002, 003, 004); two to be taught in the 1st Semester and two in the 2nd Semester.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                Normally, you will need different books for each unit course bringing the total numbers of books to 4 per course and 12 in total i.e. 4 x 3 courses. The reason is because, no one book will perfectly address the syllabus demand.
            </CText>
            <CText>
                For example, a course like literature-in-english also have list of recommended novels, drama and poetry that students will be examined based upon in the final exams. Meaning that the need for a JUPEB-focused textbook is very imperative.
